I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://www.bme.utexas.edu/) at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), working in the [AI Health Lab](https://aihealth.ischool.utexas.edu/) supervised by Prof. [Ying Ding](https://yingding.ischool.utexas.edu/) from the School of Information. I am co-advised by Prof. Mia Markey in the [Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://www.bme.utexas.edu/people/faculty-directory/markey).

My aspiration is to become a quantitative finance professional who uncovers nuanced and overlooked aspects of the financial markets. I am eagerly looking forward to a career in finance that combines my poker instincts with strong analytical skills after completing my Ph.D.

My Korean Name is Seungjun Yi (이승준).
